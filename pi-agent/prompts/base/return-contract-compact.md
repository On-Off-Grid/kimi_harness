## Return contract (final message = your ONLY result)

Your final plain-text message is the ONLY thing the coordinator receives; ending on a tool call, error, or turn limit returns "No result" and discards ALL work. So: checkpoint decisive results to files (`reports/<program>/…` or given paths) as you go; ALWAYS end with a plain-text summary — result, evidence with artifact paths, `status:` validated|candidate|needs-more-evidence|blocked, ranked next actions. State missing pieces; NEVER return empty. Blocker = success; silence = failure.
